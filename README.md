# todo-nact
A Node.js API to manage a simple todo list, using [Nact](https://github.com/ncthbrt/nact) as an actor model framework.

This web app was built as a learning experience, to pick up on the syntax and terminology provided by Nact. I wrote a corresponding article on Medium, which provides a high-level walkthrough of what Nact is, how to use it, and how it's used in this project. Feel free to read it [here](https://medium.com/@allistersmith/diving-into-event-driven-web-apps-with-node-js-and-nact-7ecbf19ed41f).

*Note:* as this was more an experiment to learn Nact, this code is far from production-ready! Feel free to fork and/or submit pull requests if you spot anything that needs doing.

# Running
Quickest way to get up an running is by cloning this repo and running `npm start`. The API will run on port 3000.

# Feedback
I would love to hear your thoughts on the codebase, or on the general topic of actor systems. Best place to comment on the article on Medium ([here](https://medium.com/@allistersmith/diving-into-event-driven-web-apps-with-node-js-and-nact-7ecbf19ed41f)).
